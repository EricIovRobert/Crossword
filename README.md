# Crossword

Crossword is a word game where a player is presented with a scrambled word and must unscramble it to form the correct word.

In this scenario, we'll assume there's a server and a client implemented in Python to facilitate the game. The server manages the game logic and communication between the client and itself, while the client represents the player who guesses the word.
